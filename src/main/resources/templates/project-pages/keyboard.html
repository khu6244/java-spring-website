		</br>
		<div>This page explains how I began my keyboard build, documents
			the process, and essentially serves as a way of expressing my pride
			in a passion project I have wanted to do for a long time and was
			ecstatic with when I finished.</div>

		<div class="keyboardContent">I bought my first mechanical
			keyboard in Grade 9, and I loved it. The tactile and auditory
			feedback, deep travel, and aesthetics of mechanical keyboard
			resonated with me from the moment I started typing. In high school, I
			had to type a lot. I wrote almost every essay, assignment, and
			project on this clunky, oversized keyboard that was absurdly loud. I
			didn't even consider that there were better options out there, but
			that changed in my first year of university.</div>
		<div class="keyboardContent">
			In first year, I decided that I wanted to learn how to solder and
			learn how to work with Arduinos. At some point, I decided that
			building a custom Arduino-powered mechanical keyboard would be the
			perfect opportunity to try both of those in the same project. I
			browsed through various online guides and posts, and eventually
			settled on the form factor found in the beginner's guide on <a
				th:href="@{//68keys.io}">68keys.io</a>. The keyboard itself is based
			on the Magicforce 68 consumer keyboard, a popular affordable starting
			point for keyboard modding. While I followed the guide for most of
			the build, I added on where I could and had to diverge slightly to
			work around some issues.

		<div style="margin-left: 30px">Lasercut Plates and PCB</div>
		<div class="keyboardContent">I began on the 68keys.io website by
			getting blank keyboard top and bottom plate CAD drawings,
			autogenerated from a website that does so based on a chosen keyboard
			layout. I needed these CAD drawings to lasercut the aluminum plates,
			but I wanted to laser etch the plates to make them personalized. I
			ended up using AutoCAD to draw my name in both English and Chinese on
			the front plate of the keyboard above the arrow keys. I had very
			little experience in PCB design at this point, having barely
			scratched the surface working in Altium Designer for RSX, the design
			team that I am a part of. Instead of designing my own, I decided to
			just use the one provided by the guide, as it was an established,
			reputable design that I knew would work and had all the features I
			wanted plus some I didn't even consider.</div>
		<div style="margin-left: 30px">Electrical Components, Switches,
			and Keycaps</div>
		<div class="keyboardContent">The next step was to decide on and
			buy keyboard switches, keycaps, various electrical components, and
			hardware. I bought an Arduino Pro Micro and a long list of assorted
			electrical parts from Digikey, mostly consisting of diodes (important
			in a mechanical keyboard to faciliate n-key rollover), resistors,
			LEDs, a micro-USB to micro-USB extension cord, as well as some
			hardware (M5 screws, standoffs, and some rubber bumpers). These are
			fairly standard components, and the interesting part comes with the
			keycaps and switch selections. My previous keyboard contained Cherry
			MX-Blue switches, which were mediocre as far as mechanical switches
			go. However, I really enjoy both the tactile and auditory feedback,
			so I opted for clicky switches as opposed to linear or tactile. I
			type extremely heavily, so I opted for switches with the strongest
			springs I could find - NovelKeys x Kailh Speed Navy Thick Clicks,
			which have about 100g of activation force. For comparison, most
			common switches activate with about 60-70g of force, so these are
			fairly heavy. I knew that I wanted blank keycaps because I can touch
			type and I would personally find them much more aesthetically
			pleasing, but blank keycaps are somewhat uncommon and I did not have
			many choices. I ended up opting for two sets of sky blue and pink
			blank keycaps on AliExpress, and mixing the two for a two-tone look.
			I opted to use blue for the alpha keys, with the exception of pink
			home row indicators. However, the keyboard layout is actually set up
			for a variant of Colemak that I am learning, which is why it makes no
			sense for QWERTY.</div>
